# Anywhere Fitness

## Introduction

These days, fitness classes can be held anywhere- a park, an unfinished basement, or a garage- not just at a traditional gym. Certified fitness instructors need an easy way to take the awkwardness out of attendance taking and client payment processing. 

## Application Instructions

The Project can be installed by running `npm i`

### Default login credentials: <br/>
`username: client@aol.com`<br/>
`password: client`

### Default instructor credentials: <br/>
`username: instructor@aol.com`<br/>
`password: instructor`

## Project Conditions

Troubles on the frontend ---

We were not able to differentiate if client or instructor was logged in so we couldn't create a edit/delete as we would not want it 
avaliable to the client. We also had trouble posting to the endpoint as well as deleting.

We also did not get a endpoint for a punchpass so we could not implement it into the project as well.
